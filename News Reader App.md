   
   News Reader App

1. App Architecture and Design

   I have used MVVM for separation of concerns:

   Model : Represents the news article data.  
   ViewModel : Handles logic and communicates with the network layer.  
   View : SwiftUI views displaying data and handling user interactions.

  I have Incorporated SOLID principles :

 Single Responsibility: Separate each responsibility into distinct classes/modules.  
 Open-Closed: Ensure components are open for extension but closed for modification.  
 Liskov Substitution: Use protocols for ViewModel and services.  
 Interface Segregation: Keep interfaces lean and specific.  
 Dependency Inversion: Use dependency injection for testability and flexibility.


2. Key Features Implementation

  a. Browsing Articles

  Fetch articles using a public API like NewsAPI.  
  Display a list of articles with titles and summaries in a  LazyVStack .  
  Integrate pull-to-refresh functionality using SwiftUI.

 b. Article Details 

 Navigate to a detailed view using  NavigationLink .  
 Show full article content in a scrollable view.

 c. Bookmarking 

 Maintain bookmarks in persistent storage like UserDefaults .  
 Show bookmarked articles in a separate view.  
 Allow users to add/remove bookmarks.

 d. Filtering by Category 

  Use a SegmentedContro  for category selection.  
 Fetch articles filtered by the selected category.

 e. Sharing via Bluetooth 

 Implement Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using  CoreBluetooth .  
 Allow nearby devices to receive shared article summaries or links.

 

 3. Technical Considerations 

 a. Network Layer 

  Use  Combine  for handling asynchronous tasks and state updates.  
 Create a generic network manager with robust error handling.  
  Map API responses to Swift structs using Codable.

 b. Dependency Injection 

  Inject dependencies (e.g., NetworkManager) into ViewModels.  
  Use a DI framework like Resolver for managing dependencies.

 c. Test Cases

 Write unit tests for ViewModel and network calls.  
 Write  UI tests for major user flows using XCTest.

d. Error Handling

Display user-friendly error messages using SwiftUI alerts.  
Handle API failures, empty states, and Bluetooth errors gracefully.



4. BLE Integration

Implement a BLE central manager to discover and connect to nearby devices.  
 Use BLE characteristics for transferring article data.  
 Handle permissions and device states (powered on/off).



5. Testing Strategy

Unit test ViewModels with mocked dependencies.  
 UI test navigation, bookmarking, and BLE sharing functionality.  
Validate network calls using stubbed responses.
